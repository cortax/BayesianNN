Make/Tests Models objects (Make: CNN, Dilated CNN, NeuralODEN, MaxoutN)
Update pipelines for "test recalling" of models (recall models to retrain midway is complete)
Add Helps to redux args ex: help='size of word embeddings'

Save history as JSON or something (required for a better restart training)
Eval metrics for significant events inside windows
Think about splitting along features instead of flights

Models: Input changes(LogNorm, Embeddings, autoencoding), 
        Output Net Changes(Better Classif/Regression Head),
        Attention, 
        Ensemble,
        RNN outputs Nets (Instead of H_n)

RNN Gradient clipping (with norm ideally)
Data delta y instead of y
