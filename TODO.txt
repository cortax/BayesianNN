Make/Tests Models objects (Make: CNN, Dilated CNN, NeuralODEN, MaxoutN)
Update pipelines for "test recalling" of models (recall models to retrain midway is complete)
Add Helps to redux args ex: help='size of word embeddings'

Save history as JSON or something (required for a better restart training)
Eval metrics for significant events inside windows

Models: Input changes(LogNorm, Embeddings, autoencoding), 
        Output Net Changes(Better Classif/Regression Head),
        Ensemble

RNN Gradient clipping (with norm ideally)
Try Data delta y instead of y
