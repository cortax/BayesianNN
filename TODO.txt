Make/Tests Models objects (Make: CNN, Dilated CNN, NeuralODEN, MaxoutN)
Remake Experiments files (pipelines)
Remake Main (Redux)
Update pipelines for "test recalling" of models

Eval metrics for significative events inside windows
Think about splitting along features instead of flights

Models: Input changes(LogNorm, Embeddings, autoencoding), 
        Output Net Changes(Better Classif/Regression Head),
        Attention, 
        Ensemble,
        RNN outputs Nets (Instead of H_n)
